## Atmosphere Codes and IPS Patches

Atmosphere codes and IPS patches for Switch games, compatible with both emulators and real Switch consoles. Codes work with EdiZon, while IPS patches are placed in the exefs_patches folder (path may vary for emulators). Customizable IPS patches can be generated using IPSwitch on your Nintendo Switch

IPS patches are codes in .ips format for quick and easy use, without needing EdiZon or copying multiple lines of code into a cheat TXT
