## Atmosphere Codes and IPS Patches

Atmosphere codes and IPS patches for Switch games, compatible with both emulators and real Switch consoles. For console, codes work with EdiZon and IPS patches are placed in the `atmosphere/exefs_patches` directory (path may vary for emulators). 

IPS Patches are files in .ips format for quick and easy use, without needing EdiZon or copying multiple long lines of code into a cheat TXT. A major plus is that the patches are always active, requiring no manual activation

Customizable IPS patches are .pchtxt files that can be converted into .ips using the IPSwitch homebrew on your Nintendo Switch, allowing you to modify the patch as you wish
