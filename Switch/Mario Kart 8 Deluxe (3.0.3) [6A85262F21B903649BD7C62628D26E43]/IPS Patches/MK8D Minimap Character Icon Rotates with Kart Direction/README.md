## Minimap Character Icon Rotates with Kart Direction

Minimap character icons will rotate based on the direction the kart is facing. Similar to how the searchlight/arrow rotates to point in the kartâ€™s direction, the same behavior will apply to the character icons.

Due to how some courses are shifted and how 3D minimap works, icon may be incorrectly rotated in some areas (facing random directions). In every Booster Course Pass course, the rotation is incorrect at all times so it was disabled in those and only show in Base Game courses

Icon will be at normal rotation in Star, Bullet and Damage. Can't be fixed
