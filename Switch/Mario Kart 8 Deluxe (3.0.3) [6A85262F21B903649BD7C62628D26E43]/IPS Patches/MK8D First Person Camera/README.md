## First Person Camera

Camera will be in First Person Camera. The camera height isn't adjusted for some karts so it may not look correct. This is more of an experimental patch.

Recommended to use with "No Item on Hand" patch, however, that patch affects everyone.

Don't use in Time Trial, it saves to the ghost! For safety, you can play Time Trials using Fishguy6564's "MK8D TT Ghost Never Saves" patch (Found in my MK8D 2023 Christmas Release Day Pack RAR)
