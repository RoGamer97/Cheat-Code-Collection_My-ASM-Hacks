## Show More Kart Statuses on Minimap

This code will show more kart statuses on minimap just like Mario Kart Tour. The statuses that are included are: Inked, Shocked, Crushed, Boo and Battle Blink.

How each status show on the minimap:
- **Shocked:** Character icon will be smaller
- **Inked:** Character icon will be black
- **Crushed:** Character icon will be squished
- **Boo/Battle Blink:** Character icon will be transparent, syncing with the transparency of the kart. Boo will only make your icon transparent as other player's icons are completely invisible. I didn't make them visible because it would be unfair advantage
