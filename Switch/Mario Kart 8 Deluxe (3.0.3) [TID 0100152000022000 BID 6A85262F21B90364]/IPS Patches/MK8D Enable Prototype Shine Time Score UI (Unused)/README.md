## Enable Prototype Shine Time Score UI (Unused)

In the Prototype version of the game there's a shine time count that shows your shine timer. It is only visible after you lose the shine for the first time and is hidden while you have the shine.
In the final game this isn't present, however, it turns out it was always in the final game but disabled on purpose. This patch enables it. It works exactly as intended!
