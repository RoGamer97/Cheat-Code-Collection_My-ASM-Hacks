## Minimap Player Arrow

Your minimap icon will have an arrow around it, facing the direction you're facing. This is the arrow from Battle Mode.

Due to how some courses are shifted and how 3D minimap works, arrow may be incorrectly rotated in some areas (facing random directions). In every Booster Course Pass course, the rotation is incorrect at all times so it was disabled in those and only show in Base Game courses
