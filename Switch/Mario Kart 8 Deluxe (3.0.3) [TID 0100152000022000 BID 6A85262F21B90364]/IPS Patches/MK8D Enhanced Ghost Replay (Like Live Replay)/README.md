## Enhanced Ghost Replay (Like Live Replay)

Basically Live Replay: when watching a Time Trial Ghost, it will opaque and it will have the player round displayed around its icon on minimap. It looks like you are playing but in reality you are watching a ghost.

Only applies when watching the ghost. When racing against it, the ghost will be transparent, and no player round will be displayed around it
