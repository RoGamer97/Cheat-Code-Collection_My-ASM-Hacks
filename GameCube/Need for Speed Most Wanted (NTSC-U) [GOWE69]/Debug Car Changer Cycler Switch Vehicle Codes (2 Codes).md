<summary>Cop Vehicle Cycler (Use w/ Debug Car Changer Cycler)</summary>

This code only works with the code above ("Debug Car Changer Cycler/Switch Vehicle"). It allows you to cycle thru all cop vehicles. You can customize the vehicle list to any vehicle you want, all you need to do is change the vehicle hashes to the 
ones you want (First hash is "BB9B2938", last one is "7D8802A6"). To get a hash, use NFS Hasher v2.0 by nfsu360 and input the vehicle string name and copy the value from "VLT Memory" to the code. Extreme fun code, can add more vehicles to the
list but the code would be too big.
Hold Y and while still holding, press the buttons to switch the vehicle (X and D-Pad Up or X and D-Pad Down)
