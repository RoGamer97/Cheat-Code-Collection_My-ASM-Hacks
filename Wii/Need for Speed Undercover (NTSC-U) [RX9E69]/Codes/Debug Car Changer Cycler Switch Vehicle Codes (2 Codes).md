<summary>Debug Car Changer Cycler/Switch Vehicle</summary>

Press Classic Controller ZL/ZR buttons to switch vehicle live, modified debug car changer that is nativally in the game. ZL cycles to the previous vehicle, ZR cycles to the next vehicle. The code below ("Cop Vehicle Cycler") allows you to cycle thru 
all cop vehicles. You can customize the vehicle list to any vehicle you want, all you need to do is change the vehicle hashes to the ones you want (First hash is "BB9B2938", last one is "7D8802A6"). To get a hash, use NFS Hasher v2.0 by nfsu360 and
input the vehicle string name and copy the value from "VLT Memory" to the code.

<summary>Cop Vehicle Cycler (Use w/ Debug Car Changer Cycler)</summary>

This code only works with the code above ("Debug Car Changer Cycler/Switch Vehicle"). It allows you to cycle thru all cop vehicles. You can customize the vehicle list to any vehicle you want, all you need to do is change the vehicle hashes to the 
ones you want (First hash is "BB9B2938", last one is "7D8802A6"). To get a hash, use NFS Hasher v2.0 by nfsu360 and input the vehicle string name and copy the value from "VLT Memory" to the code. Extreme fun code, can add more vehicles to the
list but the code would be too big. Unfortunately, because of how I coded the "Controllable Police Helicopter", you cannot control it when changing to it or can control it but it's all messed up and can't go thru walls. I noticed this too late and it's
extra long work to get it all fixed (would have to do lots of modifications on the Helicopter code), so I'll leave it like this for now, maybe another time. Sorry! You can still fly it if you select the helicopter and go to world then changing vehicles.
Don't worry though, you don't need to use the helicopter code if you don't want, plus, I added a failsafe to avoid crashing if the code is not enabled.
Hold Classic Controller D-Pad Up and while still holding, press ZR to cycle to the previous vehicle, ZR to cycle to the next vehicle. 
If you want to change the controller or button, read the "Button Activator.md" file (LINK)
