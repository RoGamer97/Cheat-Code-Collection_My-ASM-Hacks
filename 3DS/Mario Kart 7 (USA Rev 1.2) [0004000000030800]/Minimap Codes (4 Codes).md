<summary>Zoom Extended Map w/ 3D Slider</summary>

Allows zooming the extended map with the 3D slider. Unfortunately, character and item icons are not affected therefore they display the wrong location, breaking the purpose of the code. Change 40800000 (4f) to modify how much you can zoom out.
It is possible to fix this issue, it seems like I am missing some stuff

<summary>Minimap Character Icon Rotates with Kart Direction</summary>

Minimap character icons will rotate based on the direction the kart is facing. Similar to how the searchlight/arrow rotates to point in the kartâ€™s direction, the same behavior will apply to the character icons. Includes a fix for damage animation to work
