## About

Welcome to my collection of cheat codes (ASM hacks) for various games across multiple platforms. Here, you'll find many crazy, fun, cool, and useful codes to experiment with. It includes only codes made by me.

### Organization

Folders are organized by platform. Inside each platform folder, you'll find:

- **Game name folder**: Labeled with the **version** first, followed by the **Game ID**, **Title ID**, or **Build ID**, depending on the platform. The **Build ID** is used when the **Title ID** remains the same across different versions and regions.
- All the codes for that game inside the corresponding game name folder.

Some related codes are grouped together in single files. If a file name includes ```... Codes (X Codes)```, it contains multiple related codes (where X is the number of codes in that file). Be sure to review the file carefully when searching for a specific code.

Please enjoy these codes as much as I enjoyed making them!
